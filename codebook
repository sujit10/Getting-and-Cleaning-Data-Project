1.INPUT DATA
============

1.1 SOURCE:

1.2 DESCRIPTION: 
----------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six 

activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on 

the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a 

constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 

partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 

windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 

components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed 

to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 

features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. The details of the features are as follows:

1.3 FEATURE SELECTION: 
----------------------
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These 

time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median 

filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration 

signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 

Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and 

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 

tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, 

fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

2. DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
=======================

The following transformations were performed on the input data:

- The training and test datasets, including the identifiers for subjects and activities were merged to create one dataset
- Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted; these measurements include the mean

(), std(), and meanfreq() variables mentioned above.
- The activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive activity names
- The applicable feature names were added to the dataset
- Finally, the output dataset was created with the average of each activity and each subject


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


3. Output Variables
===================

As a result of the aforementioned transformations, the output dataset contains 81 variables - the first two variables are the subject 

and activity labels, whereas the remaining 79 variables are the averages by each subject and activity of the extracted measurements 

on the means and standard deviations in the input data. 

The details of the variables containing subject and activity variables are as follows:

	1)
	Name: "SubjectLabel"
	Description: unique identifier for each one of the 30 subjects in the experiment
	Class: Integer
	Range: [1,30]

	2)
	Name: "ActivityName"
	Description: name of the activity associated with a given record in the experiment
	class: Character
	Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The list of the variables containing averages by each subject and activity of the extracted measurements, is available below. For 

details on the measurements see section 1.3 Feature Selection.
